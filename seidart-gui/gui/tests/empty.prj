# This is a project file template for the SEIDART software. In order to run the
# model for seismic, electromagnetic or both, the required inputs must be
#
# Domain Input Values:
#    dim         - STR; either '2' or '2.5' but default is '2'
#    nx,ny,nz     - INT; the dimensions of the image. If dim = 2.5, and ny is
#              empty then default ny=1
#    dx,dy,dz    - REAL; the spatial step size for each dimension in meters. If
#              dim = 2.5 and dy is empty then default dy=min(dx,dz)
#
# Material Input Values:
#    id         - INT; the identifier given to each unique rgb value as it
#              is read into the computer. It's recommended to use this
#              script to make sure it's sorted correctly.
#    R/G/B         - STR; the 0-255 values for each color code.
#    Temperature     - REAL; temperature in Celsius.
#    Attenuation     - REAL; (placeholder) will be attenuation length soon.
#    Density     - REAL; density in kg/m^3
#    Porosity     - REAL; percent porosity
#    Water_Content     - REAL; percent of pores that contain water
#    Anisotropic     - BOOL; whether the material is anisotropic (True) or
#              isotropic (False).
#    ANG_File     - STR; if Anisotrpic is True then the full path to the
#              .ang file is supplied. The .ang file is a delimited text
#              file that contains the 3-by-n array of euler rotation
#              angles in radians.
#
#        or alternatively...
#    C11-C66     - REAL; the stiffness coefficients with the appropriate id
#    E11-E33,S11-S33    - REAL; the permittivity and conductivity coefficients and
#              'id' value corresponding to the coefficients along the diagonal
#              of their respective tensors.
#
#
# Source Input Values:
#    dt         - REAL; dx/(2*maxvelcity)
#    steps         - INT; the total number of time steps
#    x,y,z         - REAL; locations in meters, +z is down, +y is into the screen
#    f0         - REAL; center frequency for the guassian pulse function if
#              'source_file' isn't supplied
#    theta         - REAL; source orientation in the x-z plane,
#    phi         - REAL; source orientation in the x-y plane for 2.5/3D only,
#    source_file    - STR; the pointer to the text file that contains the source
#              timeseries as a steps-by-1 vector.
